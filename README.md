# Description

This project showcases a login system created with PHP, where user sessions are handled using *session_start()*. 
The session mechanism allows data to be stored and accessed across multiple pages, ensuring that the userâ€™s 
information persists during their interaction with the site.

## To ensure the security of user data, several protective measures are employed:

*empty()*: This function checks whether input fields (like username and password) are filled out.

*SANITIZE*: This step prevents harmful code, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, from being injected 
into form fields

# Main Features 
- Input Validation
- PHP and CSS
- Data Sanitization
